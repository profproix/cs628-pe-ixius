This is a to-do list application where users can enter tasks that get rendered on the screen. Each task can also be deleted if no longer needed. The App component holds the todo state, which is passed to the higher-order TodoList component. TodoList maps over the array and renders each task using the TodoTask component, assigning a unique key and passing the task as a prop.

Each task has a delete button linked to an event handler from App. When clicked, the task is passed up, and filter() is used to remove it from the list. Since filter() returns a new array instead of mutating the original, it avoids issues with JavaScriptâ€™s pass-by-reference behavior.

The app also features a controlled form, meaning form data is managed in state. On every input change, state updates in real-time. When submitted, the task is added using a function from App, ensuring immutability with the spread operator and keeping the task list updated efficiently.
